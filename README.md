## Topology in IQHE

- [ ] Background and Motivation
- [ ] Laughlin's argument
- [ ] TKNN formula
- [ ] Synthetic magnetic field

## Spin-Orbit Coupling

- [ ] Background and Motivation
- [ ] Atomic SOC as a relativistic effect
- [ ] Example: SOC in Graphene

## Effective Hamiltonian

### Symmetry-constrained k-dot-p model

- [ ] Background and Motivation

- [ ] From atomic orbital by perturbations: 
  $$
  SO(3)\rightarrow O_{h}\rightarrow\cdots
  $$

- [ ] By Invariants
